    <h2>🧠 From Beginner to Web Developer: My 6-Month Learning Journey</h2>
    <p class="date">Posted on November 12, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Six months ago, I didn’t know what HTML or CSS really were. I had seen websites and thought, “How do people make these?” Today, I can confidently say I’m a web developer — and this is the story of how I got here.
    </p>

    <h3>📅 Month 1: The Spark</h3>
    <p>
      I started with the basics — learning what the web actually is. I spent my first month understanding how websites work, what HTML does, and how CSS adds style. I built my very first “Hello World” webpage and customized it with my favorite colors. That tiny success motivated me like nothing else.
    </p>

    <h3>💻 Month 2: Learning HTML & CSS Properly</h3>
    <p>
      I went deeper into HTML elements and CSS selectors. I practiced creating layouts using <code>flexbox</code> and <code>grid</code>. This is also when I discovered responsive design — making websites look good on phones, tablets, and desktops. I built my first mini project: a personal profile card!
    </p>

    <h3>⚙️ Month 3: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      Once I was comfortable styling pages, I wanted them to *do* something. JavaScript felt intimidating at first, but I took it one step at a time — variables, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation. My favorite small project that month was a simple “to-do list” app where I could add and remove tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>🌐 Month 4: Building Real Projects</h3>
    <p>
      By month four, I was combining everything I learned to build complete websites. I created a portfolio layout, an image gallery, and even a small landing page. I also learned about Git and GitHub — how to track my changes and publish projects online using GitHub Pages.
    </p>

    <h3>🚀 Month 5: Exploring APIs and Advanced Topics</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to connect my sites to real data, so I learned about APIs. My first API project was a weather app that fetched real-time weather data. It blew my mind to see my code interact with the internet! I also explored modern tools like VS Code, Chrome DevTools, and responsive testing.
    </p>

    <h3>🎯 Month 6: Building My Portfolio & Sharing My Work</h3>
    <p>
      The final month was all about putting everything together. I designed and coded my personal portfolio (the one you’re viewing now!), used Formspree to add a working contact form, and hosted everything using GitHub Pages. I also started this blog to document my growth and share what I’ve learned.
    </p>

    <h3>💬 Lessons I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning by doing is the fastest way to grow.</li>
      <li>Don’t fear mistakes — debugging is part of the fun.</li>
      <li>Small, consistent progress beats long, random sprints.</li>
      <li>Build projects, even tiny ones — every project teaches something new.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>✨ What’s Next</h3>
    <p>
      My next goal is to learn a front-end framework like React and start exploring backend development. I also plan to contribute to open-source projects to collaborate with other developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re just starting out, remember this: six months ago, I was exactly where you are now. Stay curious, keep building, and one day soon, you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come.
